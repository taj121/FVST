\chapter{Conclusion}

The objectives of this project were to first develop an understanding of Session types and behaviours specifically related to the work done in (Spacasassi \& Koutavas)\cite{paper1} and to implement the design for a behaviour checker detailed in said paper. This has been done in the fashion detailed in this report. The early chapters of this report detail the depth of my understanding of session types and behaviours as well as my understanding of the paper \cite{paper1}. The implementation of the behaviour checker is complete, its behaviour has been detailed in \ref{examplesChapt}, and has been tested in the fashion detailed in \ref{chaptest}. 

In conclusion the objectives of this project have been met.
