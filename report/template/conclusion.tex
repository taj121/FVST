\chapter{Conclusion}

Throughout the duration of this project 

\section{Evaluation of Objectives}

The objectives of this project were met. That is to say that an understanding of session types and the current attempt to verify them was achieved. In the initial plan for this project it was thought that time might allow for the implementation of the inference algorithms and their integration with the behaviour checker for a more complete implementation of the second level of the system from (Spaccassi \& Koutavas)\cite{paper1}. This however proved to be impractical in the time allocated. 

The testing detailed in \ref{chaptest} shows that the implementation of the behaviour checker is complete and that it functions in the expected fashion. 

\section{Reflection on Process}

The process of development of this project could perhaps have been improved. Starting out by spending a bit more time studying the paper and perhaps first writing some simple programs in OCaml might have saved some time on developing the behaviour checker. It would certainly have helped when technical difficulties with the language were encountered.
